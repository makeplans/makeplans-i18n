# Localisation files for MakePlans

Pull requests are much welcome :) You can modify existing locales or add a new one. Please contact us if you have any questions.

Please be aware that date and time sections should not be updated as they are currently used in some code specific situations (datepicker etc) so we have to adjust it manually. But please let us know what changes you want and we can have a look.
