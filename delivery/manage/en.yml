        Hi,

        Hi there,

        Looks like you enabled the API on your Makeplans account %{subdomain}. How awesome!

        If you know what you are doing then you can just ignore this email.

        But if you are new to the Makeplans API please do check out the documentation at https://developer.makeplans.com.
        You will find information about authentication, all endpoints, webhooks, as well as examples.
        Any questions? Just contact us, happy to help you out.

        If you are experimenting it could be a good idea to create an API development account in our test environment. There are some restrictions there but generally it is preferred to develop in a separate environment and account than your actual account.
        You can find a link to the test environment in the API documentation.

        Happy coding!
